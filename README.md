# ipmitw

A simple wrapper around ipmitool. It helps avoid some of the repetitive
verbosity of ipmitool and simplifies running the same command on multiple
machines.

It's written in POSIX-compliant sh, and should run on just about any *nix.

request. Patches and (constructive) input are always welcome.
